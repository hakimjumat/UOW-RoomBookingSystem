# UOW Room Booking System Website
Prototype of front-end room booking website for my CSIT214 IT Project Management module. HTML, CSS and Javascript was utilised to create a static local website. 


Highlighted features:

• Room creation and management : only done by a staff user, he/she shall be able to 1) create a 
room, 2) launch a room (make available for reservations of a newly created room), 3) adjust the 
price (each booking is chargeable), date/time, promotional codes, and capacity of room.  
• Room booking : only done by a student user, he/she can 1) view the list of rooms available, 2) 
make a booking of one or more rooms, 3) modify an existing booking and 4) cancel an existing 
booking.

# *Important
